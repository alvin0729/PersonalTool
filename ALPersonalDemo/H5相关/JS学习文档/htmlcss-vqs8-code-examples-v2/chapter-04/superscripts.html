	<h1>Famous Catalans</h1>

	<p>When I was in the sixth grade, I played the cello. There was a teacher at school who always used to ask me if I knew who "Pablo Casals" was. I didn't at the time (although I had met Rostropovich once at a concert). Actually, Pablo Casals' real name was <i>Pau</i> Casals, Pau being the Catalan equivalent of Pablo<a href="#footnote-1" title="Read footnote 1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

	<p>In addition to being an amazing cellist, Pau Casals is remembered in this country for his empassioned speech against nuclear proliferation at the United Nations<a href="#footnote-2" title="Read footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a>, which he began by saying, "I am a Catalan. Catalonia is an oppressed nation."</p>

sub 和 sup 元素会轻微地增大行高。幸好，用一点 CSS 就可以修复这个问题。下面的代码来自 Nicolas Gallagher 和 Jonathan Neal 出色的 normalize.css（http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/）。
下面的方法并不是他们发明的，他们借用了 https://gist.github.com/413930 里的代码并去掉了注释。
